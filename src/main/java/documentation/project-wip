CHANGE/ADD BACKEND FEATURES:


- Backend TODO:

Result should be being able to search and the actual results of our logic pop up as results
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE/ADD FRONTEND FEATURES:


- Frontend TODO:
(do backend first before this)
Do some work to make the Javascript work with the back end, including making the individual option work

Add good form-validation
Make admin page nicer


- Frontend general ideas:
Feature where you can open up a bigger, modal view of a card with a button in its top left corner w/ css transition
Feature where you can give feedback/suggestions for the site
Feature that highlights the text that is currently being spoken in the transcript
doesnt load all yt videos (though perhaps their thumbnails?), instead you can click on it and it brings up the modal


- Easter eggs:
Could dedicate an entire JS file for the easter eggs and look up ways to obfuscate it from being read
