TEXT-ISSUES WITH CHARACTERS:


- Illegal Characters (18/4/24):
1. only in the names of the transcript files will there be the weird vertical bar.
    in our transcripts it will be the regular vertical bar |.
    i think the weird bar might be a yt-dlp thing, because it's only there -
    in the normal yt titles its the regular vertical bar.
2. TranscriptUseTest.checkIfAnyTitlesHaveIllegalCharacters();
    does catch any illegal characters in our file titles, though not exhaustive in making sure titles are 1-1.
    this is because sometimes it doesn't convert it to an illegal character it just converts it to a legal one.
    so there has to be some manual testing, of going through the titles and checking if anything has been converted (but to a legal char)


- Phantom Space Issue(18/4/24):
titles with phantom space(actual on yt, file name):

Text with a phantom space:
A Sad Tale Of A Man & His Car .. | Jalopy -> "should take that  back they can't do"
    (yt-dlp problem) he says shit where the extra space is
Chib Plays Piano [_rfj7wvHm9w] -> "what the go away  off yo target"
    (yt-dlp problem) he says fuck where the extra space is

Conclusion:
chiblee hasn't intentionally double spaced any title
    every title's double space either comes before or after a symbol or number
2 transcript's text have a random space in them.
    both times he said a swear word and yt-dlp interpreted it as a space somehow,
    and that space starts at the beginning of a new line every time, so its really only 1 space
root cause is yt-dlp, not me

Fixed by:
done in the method that reads the files (right at the start),
we use convertIllegalFileNameCharactersBackToNormal() and convertLegalFileNameCharactersBackToNormal()
this changes any phantom spacing in the title to a single space, and any in the text to explicit

OTHER ISSUES:


- Spring Boot loading stylesheets/scripts (6/6/24):
When I load the webpages from the Intellij they load, but when I run Spring Boot and look at localhost they are blocked,
the solution to this is to change the file path (remove the /static from the beginning)
I've had this happen before but I haven't worked on this for a while so I forgot
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting things:
- If in this documentation there aren't dates for information, then it was written on the same date as it's title
- The transcript with the name "Animal Crossing Gamecube (Alpha build footage) 1999" only contains 92 characters.
- The titles "Fortnite with Friends" and "Mario Kart with Chat (Part 8)" are both used as titles in 2 separate videos,
    leading to the key now also containing the id as the title is no longer unique. (21/4/24)
- The largest parsed text has 400,000 characters, so that's why our MYSQL uses MEDIUMTEXT - which is good up to 16.7m characters
- Proud of writing InvertedIndexService.filterInvertedIndexForCloseTimestamps()
